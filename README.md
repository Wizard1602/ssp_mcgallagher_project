>  Full CSV outputs for Task 1 and Task 4 caused me a little bit of trouble uploading because they exceeded the GitHub 100 MB file size limit.
>
> Note: The full CSV outputs for Task 1 (task1_all_pull_request.csv) and Task 4 (task4_pr_commit_details.csv) exceed GitHub’s 100MB file size limit, so they are not stored in this repository. They can be regenerated locally by running:
> - task1_all_pull_request.py
> - task4_pr_commit_details.py
